h1. AdiSpellHUD

Spell overlay customization and spell state HUD.

The configuration panel is available using the standard addon menu.

h2. Class and spell support

The spells supported by the cooldown and aura modules are hard-coded. To keep them simple, I am not planning to add a configuration UI. However, contributions are welcome. I accept pull requests on github.com as long as you respect these four rules: indent with tabs, align with spaces, remove trailing spaces and comment in english.

h2. Modules

AdiSpellHUD is composed of three modules, that can be enabled/disabled separately.

h3. Cooldowns

Displays a big flashing icon in the center of the screen each time a configured cooldown finishes.

Configuration options:
* cooldowns to show,
* size, opacity and position of the animation.

h3. Auras

Displays a bar of icons for important (de)buffs. Tracks class spells, trinket and enchant procs, encounter debuffs and bloodlust.

Configuration options:
* auras to show,
* size, opacity and position of the icon bar.

h3. Spell overlay customization

Displays a countdown on Blizzard fullscreen animations. You can also resize and move them.

Configuration options:
